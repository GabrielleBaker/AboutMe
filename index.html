            <h2 class="headertext">About Me</h2><img src="images/GBaker.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Baker">
           Born and raised in sunny South Africa, also known as the rainbow nation due to its rich cultural diversity, my early childhood years were spent in Pretoria, the executive capital of the country, before moving to the Western Cape to enjoy a more nature enriched lifestyle. 
           <br>I come from a large family, wherein I am the middle child with four sisters. Our family is blended in a cultural sense, with my mother coming from an English background and my father from an Afrikaans one. 
           <br>I have always been a creative person, which led me to my first career as a hairstylist. 
           <br>I moved to Finland in December 2020 with my significant other Jaryd. We currently reside in the capital region -Uusimaa and enjoy spending our days geeking out by playing fantasy games and reading. 
           <br>Currently I study Business Information Technology at Haaga Helia University of Applied Sciences with a core passion for programming and website development.
           <br>We look forward to welcoming a puppy into our home, hopefully in the near future.
